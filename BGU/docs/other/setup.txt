sources I took help from:
https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#inbox/FMfcgzGxTFTtdjgwZSkcMRvjkpzhrwJH
https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym
https://github.com/NVlabs/storm/blob/main/install_instructions.md

steps I took:


******
1. mkdir /home/dan/sw/storm_dan
2. git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/storm
3. download isaacgym directory from: https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym
4. cp /home/dan/Downloads/IsaacGym_Preview_4_Package/isaacgym /home/dan/sw/storm_dan/storm 

5. change next files: to these specifications (by the recomendation of elias):
File 1: /home/dan/sw/thesis/storm_dan/storm/environment.yml was changed to:

11. pip install -e .
12. cd ./python/examples 
13. python3 joint_monkey.py # should start gui - verify isaacgym works well
14. cd /home/dan/sw/storm_dan/storm 
15. python3 scripts/train_self_collision.py # verify it works - should do some calculation no gui
16. (storm_kit) dan@dan-US-Desktop-Codex-R:~/sw/thesis/storm_dan/storm/examples$ python3 franka_reacher.py  # verify gui starts and works fine
17. nvidia-smi #observe and verify nvidia memory usage with  command from terminal
